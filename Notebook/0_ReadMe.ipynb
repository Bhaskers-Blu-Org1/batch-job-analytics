    "# Batch job analysis: Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Running batch jobs is an essential operation on IBM Z or mainframe. Everyday, up to 60,000 batch jobs are run on a typical mainframe system, and that number tends to double on the first and last day of each calendar month, quarter, and year. Analysis of logs and other output from this large workload requires the analytics of a machine learning solution like IBM Watson Machine Learning for z/OS (WMLz).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use WMLz to analyze your batch processing and extract insights to enhance the following aspects of your batch operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Seasonability of batch jobs and trends of workload change\n",
    "* Impact of transactions and other business operations to batch job elapsed time\n",
    "* Prediction of elapsed time of long-running jobs\n",
    "* Identification of potentially abnormal job instances as well as transaction volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code pattern is a sample project that uses WMLz 2.1.0.3 for batch job analysis. The hypothetical project supposes that the system administrators at BankABC use the Python notebook and modeler flow capabilities of WMLz to analyze batch jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* BankABC runs a Master Batch Job(MBJ) at midnight everyday. MBJ consists of more than 10,000 jobs that cover various types of mission-critical transactions. \n",
    "* BankABC wants to analyze MBJ elapsed time and to find out the pattern of changes in elapsed time, the most impactful factors responsible for the changes, and the correlation between elapsed time and daily transaction volume. \n",
    "* BankABC also wants to know if MBJ elapsed time is predictable. Usually, MBJ runs for 2~5 hours at midnight. The ability to predict the time of job completion will allow the bank to arrange MBJ and maintenance jobs to avoid interrupting its normal business operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the project, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extract batch job operation data from SMF Type 30 records\n",
    "* Explore log data to extract insights about batch job elapsed time \n",
    "* Use various algorithms to predict batch job elapsed time \n",
    "* Identify potentially abnormal job instances and correlation with transaction volume\n",
    "* Learn to use WMLz web UI where you can use Jupyter Notebooks to code in Python and SPSS Modeler Flow to explore data and train model in canvas\n",
    "* Read z/OS native files, including SMF Type 30 records with Python notebook based on mainframe data service.\n",

    "## What is included ?\n",
    "   **The project includes the following folders and files:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder contains the following CSV files to be used as input data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `df_smf.csv` contains sample output of `1_BatchJob_SMF30Extract.ipynb`. The output is the batch job run time metrics that will be the most important input data for analysis.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "   SMF provides a common interface a z/OS operation log for extracting system operation measurements. SMF Type 30 includes records of batch job operations. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `MasterBatchJob.csv` contains sample data of MBJ lapsed time over the period of one year. MBJ elapsed time refers to the minutes between the start time of the first job and the end time of the last job in MBJ recorded in `df_smf.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TxnVolume.csv` contains information about transaction volumes of various business types over the period of one year.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `calendar_join.csv` contains calendar data with \"calenday\" elements like weekday, day, month, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `widetable_MBJ.csv` contains a joined wide table of MBJ elapsed time, transaction volumes, and calendar data, ready for model training in `3_BatchJob_MBJ_Prediction.ipynb`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Notebook \n",
    "This folder contains the following Python notebooks. You can open and run each of them in your Jupyter web environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `0_readme.ipynb` provides an overview of this sample project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `1_BatchJob_SMF30Extract.ipynb` extracts batch job run time operation data from SMF Type 30 log files. See IBM Knowledge Center for information about SMF Type 30 records. Because SMF Type 30 log files are usually large in size, they are not included in the project package. Only a small sample output from this `df_smf.csv` is included for your information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `2_BatchJob_MBJ_DataExploration.ipynb` explores MBJ elapsed time, gains insights on trend in timeline, and examines correlation between daytime business volumes and periodicity in day, week, and month.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `3_BatchJob_MBJ_Prediction.ipynb` applies different methods for predicting MBJ elapsed time that is based on historical data, calendar information, or business transaction volume data.<br>\n",
    "    Note: In WMLz, reading a local data set in a notebook cell requires an authentication token. A WMLz administrator sets the expiration date of the token. In case of token expiration and authentication failure, click the top right button in the UI to replace the expired token.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder contains the following SPSS modeler flows. You can open them in canvas and use drop-and-draw to explore. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* `4_BatchJob_MBJ_TSPredict.str` applies the time series algorithm to predict MBJ elapsed time.\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "* `5_BatchJob_MBJ_AnomalyDetect.str` detects anomaly in elapsed time and business transaction volumes.\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "### ProjectZIP\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder contains compressed files `BatchJobAnalytics.zip` and `BatchJobAnalytics.tar.gz`. The content of the two files is the same, with `.zip` to be used on Windows or Mac and `tar.gz` on Linux. You can import one of the files to add the sample project to your WMLz workspace. Adding the project will also add the same Python notebooks and data sets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### View\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder contains the following output files of the sample project:   \n",
    "\n",
    "* Four read-only html files that are the output from the Python notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Four screenshots from modeler flows that are prediction results and records of detected abnormal job instances.\n",
